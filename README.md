# Cover letter generator
Nix flake for writing a cover letter.  
In the dev shell, when writing `*.md` files in Vim, a PDF is generated with pandoc. A PDF viewer that supports hot reloading (Skim for MacOS) allows a live editing experience with any tooling.  
  
The minimal letter example is located at
